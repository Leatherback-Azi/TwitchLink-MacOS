## Support & Issues

### Notice

**TwitchLink** is a Free & Open Source Project.

I made this for those who were disappointed about Twitch's behavior on DMCA problems, which made a lot of streamers to delete their clips, and stop saving their live replays.
With TwitchLink, you can download streams, videos, and clips to make an archive of your channel.

I'm just a university student, not an experienced software engineer, and this is not my job.
I'm developing TwitchLink in my free time for no money.
Which means, my response or patch might be slow.
Just be patient, it may take a while for me to look at it.

I'm not a native speaker, so some translations would be awkward.
Let me know if some of my expressions should be changed.
